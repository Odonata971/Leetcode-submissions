## Motivation

As a programmer, solving coding problems is an excellent way to improve problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms and data structures, and prepare for technical interviews. By committing to solving LeetCode problems daily, I aim to continuously enhance my coding abilities and stay sharp.

## Problems

Each problem is organized in a separate folder, named according to the LeetCode problem number and title. Within each folder, you'll find:

- `problem.md`: A file containing the problem statement and any additional information or constraints.
- `solution.py` (or the appropriate file extension for your preferred language): The source code file containing my solution to the problem.
- `README.md` (optional): A file with additional notes, explanations, or thought process related to the solution.

## Technologies

The solutions in this repository are primarily written in Java, but I may occasionally use other programming languages as well. The specific language used for each problem will be evident from the file extension.
